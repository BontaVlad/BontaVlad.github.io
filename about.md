Fail fast, fail early, fail often!

I am a software developer with 6 years of experience â€“ mostly in web related projects running on Linux.

Professionally, I gravitate around Python, Django and Javascript(client side).

My open-source projects vary from the usual Django apps / Python wrappers / etc. to the genuinely interesting Nim issues or Nim related projects one of them being nimpy(a Python - Nim bridge).

I love hosting presentations at my local Python meetup group, and when the stars align, I publish an article on my personal blog.
