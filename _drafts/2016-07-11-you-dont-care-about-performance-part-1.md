My take on python profiling, definitions, motives, tools, cavesets and a hands
on approach to profile a fictive car part shop.

You **don't** care about performance, before you rant at me and include my mother in the conversation, answer some of these following questions:

- Do you test for performance?
- If you do, you do it in a automatic and repeatable manner?
- Do you track, analyze and categorize the results?

>If you answered yes to most of these questions, you could stick around for [part two](#part2) in which I try to play with some useful profiling tools like [locust.io], [django-silk] or maybe you are curios to see the special [app] that I build especially for this demonstration. For the rest of you, read on.

Profiling is a **complex** topic, so my take on this is to split it in two parts:

- [**Part one**](#part1) will be a superficial quick and general introduction to profiling python, no prior knowledge required<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>, I just want to make sure that we are on the same page.

- [**Part two**](#part2) is where we get our hands dirty and simulate a work flow of profiling a application. This part will require from you some advance topics, but fear not, still accessible to most of the readers out there.

Profiling for performance<sup>[2](#f2)</sup>
--------------------------------------------

I've used the term *profiling* several times before but never said explained anything about it.

According to wikipedia:

> Profiling (computer programming) is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of functions calls. Most commonly, profiling information servers to aid program optimization.

With other words: profiling shows you here you are spending most of you're time, it enables you to optimize your code in a intelligent fashion, runs **almost** exactly the same code as in production. You can easily<sup>[3](#f3)</sup> track entry/exit times for functions and helps you build the bigger picture about the application.

**TD;LR;**

- How much of resource X<sup>[4](#f4)</sup> is used?
- How exactly this amount of X is spent?
- Looking for bottlenecks

Why do we profile python?
------------------------

Because (and it hurts to say this) **cPython** is slow. Python is a beautiful language, but the rumor spread around by jealous Java programmers is sadly true.

So why not make Python faster?

Well, that is exactly what the project [PyPy] is trying to do.

PyPy is a automated, runtime, profile-driven optimization a.k.a. JIT compiler, because PyPy tries to tackle a non-trivial problem we are not quite there yet.

Even so, at the moment, computers still aren't powerful enough to restructure your entire program to use a better suited algorithm for the job.

So until then we profile.

Why not optimize everything?
--------------------------

>Fast code is expensive

Well, this is exactly what the *wizards* of yesterday did, they wrote code in which every cpu cycle, every piece of memory mattered, *controll everything* was the name of the game. They had no other way.

But this level of care comes at a cost, fast code is expensive because it takes effort to write (*good*) fast code. It needs better algorithms, deep research into approaches, diligent and focused effort.

>Fast code is hard to maintain

Smart code introduces *caches*, *lazy loading*, *parallelization*, *assumptions* and *requirements*.

Much smarter code gets you to *"meta-programming obscure"*, code where nothing you write is the code that runs.

Sure it's fast, but it is extremely slow to write, and slow to maintain.

We need fast but maintainable code, so we give up right?

**No**, we do *"Intelligent optimization"*.

Obligatory Quote

>"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%" -Knuth

The trick here is to mess up only a small portion of the code base, while preserving the elegance of the whole.  Maintain nice flexibility and ugly just the important 3%.

How to find the 3%?
------------------

>Why not guess? "I really understand my code"

Well probably you do, and probably most of the time you do a good job. Better to look first or else you are taking a bet every time you do this.

What tools do I have?
---------------------
Before thinking at the tools, let's split them according to some general rules of thumb.

### Overview of the available tools
1. What is being profiled?
    - CPU usage
    - RAM usage
    - I/O or network
2. How it is profiled?
    - Deterministic (one instruction at a time,
                     precise information, slow
                     generates huge amount of data)
    - Statistical (looks at the stack from time to time,
                   not a precise, fast
                   generates managable amount of data)
3. Which granularity?
    - Application-level
    - Method-level
    - Line-level
4. How it is reported?
    - Textual reports
    - Color mode
    - Exploding pies
    - Square maps
    - Call graphs

### The tools
- Run time, aggregate ("snippet-level") : [timeit]
- Run time, method-level, deterministic : [cProfile]
- Runtime, method-level, statistical    : [statprof.py]
- Runtime, line-level, deterministic    : [line_profiler]
- Memory, line-level, deterministic     : [memory_profiler]
- Memory, method-level, deterministic   : [pympler] (Py2/3)
                                          [guppy/heapy] (Py2)

This brings us to the end of [Part 1](#part1). As promised, in [Part 2] we start to play with the tools above, profiling the [app] I mentioned at the start of the article. I hope we see each other there.

**Cool stuff**

1. [Profile for performance](http://pyvideo.org/video/1587/profiling-for-performance) *I stole a lot of information from this wonderful presentation*
2. [Advance Python Profiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUCMjsrYSrQ) *Excellent presentation with tons of code examples*
