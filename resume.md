# Experience

### Spyhce
*March 2014 – Present | Cluj County, Romania*

With Spyhce, I am part of a team of developers and designers that specializes in
creating web-based applications for clients all around the world.
My primary role is that of a full stack developer, working mostly in **python**(django)
and **javascript**(AngularJs, Jquery).
<br/>

**Projects at Spyhce that I worked on:**

* #### Confidential
> The project is a statistic platform for betting enthusiasts. Users can buy
> widgets for several dashboards and teams with game statistics in order to make
> better bets. Second part of the application involved aggregating match
> statistics and bets odds from different betting platforms.
> I was the **lead backend developer** on the project working closely with the
> front end developer. The project architecture was split in two major parts,
> back end acting as a provider of a service and the front end being the
> consumer.
<br/>
> **Worked with: Django, All-Auth, Rest-framework, Redis, Celery, Swagger, REST**

* #### Moody365
> Social media application with the mission of providing it's users with a day
> by day snapshot of photos, interactions, activities made.

> individual job- and labour market. This will help them to avoid uncertainty,
> anticipate the future, take better and faster decisions and just be more
> successful.
> Application that puts in contact job seekers with job offers using a neural
> network based on personality, experiences etc.
> Was responsible for making a REST API for mobile version of the website, bug fixing.
<br/>
> **Worked with: Django, Rest-framework, Rest-auth, PostMan, Refactoring tools, Intensive Debugging**

* #### 8vance mobile
> Mobile version of 8vance.
> Build by me from the ground up using Ionic framework.
> Special mentions: Difficulties faced because the back end architecture wasn't
> build for access from third party apps, lazy loading of application resources
> in order to make them more configurable and increase application performance.
<br/>
> **Worked with: Rest-framework, Ionic, Cordova, Android SDK, Gulp, Bower**

* #### SmartFeedz
> Social Media Aggregator that aims to collect Social Media messages about
> an event or brand page, from several different sources, and present them live
> during an event. Pictures, videos and any kind of social media feedback will
> be presented in real time as people are interacting on different Social Media
> channels.
> Responsibilities: Made REST endpoints for the application, implemented caching
> of scrapped data in ElasticSearch to improve performance and better aggregate and
