# Blog

This is the third iteration of my blog. I've also written a [detailed meta-post](http://eyeshalfclosed.com/blog/2013/07/30/building-this-blog/) on its construction.

## Powered By

This is now powered by Jekyll, and auto-built and hosted on Github pages. Previously, I've tried:

   * [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/): See my [old blog](http://halfclosed.wordpress.com/).
   * [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org): See my [nanoc blog](http://emaadmanzoor.github.io/eyeshalfclosed/blog/).

## Design

The theme this blog wears is hand-crafted; I found it way easier than adapting someone else's theme.

Some of the themes I considered before rolling my own are:

   * [Minimal Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme.html): This is a beautiful theme by Michael Rose, but the code presented too great a learning curve.
   * [So Simple](http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme.html): Another beautiful theme by Michael Rose, with the same problem as above.
   * [Greyshade](http://shashankmehta.in/archive/2012/greyshade.html): A Medium-esque Octopress theme.
   * [Left](http://zachholman.com/posts/left/): A clean, white Jekyll theme.

The design has some key influencers:

   * [The PureCSS Blog Layout](http://purecss.io/layouts/blog/): PureCSS also forms the backbone of this blog.
   * [Medium.com](http://medium.com): Particularly their layout for an individual post.
   * [Aaron Moodie's Blog](http://aaronmoodie.com/): Follows a Tumble-log style, with different post types.
   * [mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com/): An inspiration for life too.
   
I also use icons from [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).
