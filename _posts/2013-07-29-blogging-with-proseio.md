And here's a post written in [prose.io](http://prose.io)! No longer will I need to clone and build my Jekyll site locally, and hope that the computer at hand has half-decent Vim syntax highlighting.

My new workflow will consist of simply firing up a prose.io editor and creating a new draft. I can preview my draft while composing, and when I'm finally done, I simply convert my draft to a post with the push of a button.

There's also the option of a live-preview within your Jekyll blog, but I've not gotten it working just yet.

I'm happy now. I hope this is the last blog migration I have to make.
