I stumbled across this gem on
[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pbjk1/what_are_the_small_lifestyle_changes_youve_made/c3o3ejr).

but as soon as you find yourself with some free time you probably get that urge to check Reddit,
open that game you were playing, see what you're missing on Facebook, etc.

what you really want to do; those long-term things you're working on, or even the basic stuff
you need to do today, like cooking, getting ready for exercise, etc.

yourself endlessly surfing Reddit, Facebook, etc. trying to fill a void in yourself, trying to
find out what you're missing, but never feeling satisfied.

yourself, these distractions start to feel like a waste of time. You check Facebook just to
make sure you're not missing anything important directed at you, but scrolling down and reading
random stuff in your feed feels like stepping out into the Disneyland parking lot to listen to
what's playing on the car radio - a complete waste of time compared to what you're really doing
today.

I either start my day like this and feel normal and productive, or I look up and realize it's
early evening, I haven't accomplished anything and I can't bring myself to focus no matter how
hard I want to.

In the excitement and belief that it's always a good thing,
we strive to make progress, to start things, build something new,
resonating to the ring of a different, if not better, tomorrow.

Clambering along the strands of the interweb, clicking through
links like hammers against the Berlin wall, making progress,
our neurons process pixel after pixel into meaning, evolving
hoarded information into ideas we contribute back, for others
to consume and evolve in turn.

When the neural sweatshop shuts for the day, I ask myself:

> What have I finished today?

The price of incompletion is high, something I realised while
working my way through [Interview Street](http://www.interviewstreet.com),
where one is eligible to apply for companies only after
solving 7 questions *completely*. *Almost* solving a dozen questions
only implies the inability to construct a complete solution.

It's time I stop running in circles and inch towards the finish line.
I'm following the breadcrumbs back to pick up the pieces. It's time
I start building the wholes to which they belong.
