title: On Profanity in Science
tags: reading-notes
---

I came across a slightly old paper on [Studying the Source Code of Scientific Research](http://www.sigkdd.org/sites/default/files/issues/14-2-2012-12/V14-02-07-Cormode.pdf). The section on *The Sacred and the Profane* had me in fits. It reminded me of the less academic but equally hilarous analogue from software development: [Commit Logs from Last Night](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/).

Quoted below for memory:

> In other cases however, it seems that profanity is used internally
to reflect the author’s true feelings: there are examples
where a particularly difficult example is given the (internal)
label “bastard”; a macro for a complexity class is given the
handle “crap”; and an initial theorem is labeled “bullshit”
with an improvement provided.
>
> One particular notable example
is of the occurrence of “bollocks” (a British-English
idiom with broadly negative connotation) which occurs over
fifty times within a single paper. Closer inspection reveals
that this is because the central theorem in the paper is
given the label “dogs-bollocks” and referred to extensively
throughout; this phrase is a (coarse) British-English idiom
with a strongly *positive* connotation.
>
>There are examples of profanity used in comments: the observation that “the \thanks layout looks crappy!”; the single word “bullshit”
prefacing some technical text which has been commented
out; and the comment “Who the fuck is —?” immediately
after an acknowledgment to the named individual.

The rest of the paper is as enjoyable and illuminating; a rare combination, but coming from Muthukrishnan (depicted below on fire), possibly expected.
