It's my first time coming across computer science literature that reads like one of
Bertrand Russell's philosophical pieces. Here's an excerpt from the foreword I've just
gotten past; if you've taken a course in programming languages this semester, steal this book!

> Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These
processes, arising from human experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail,
and at any time only partially understood. They are modeled to our permanent satisfaction rarely
by our computer programs. Thus even though our programs are carefully handcrafted discrete
collections of symbols, mosaics of interlocking functions, they continually evolve: we change
them as our perception of the model deepens, enlarges, generalizes until the model ultimately
attains a metastable place within still another model with which we struggle. The source of the
exhilaration associated with computer programming is the continual unfolding within the mind and
on the computer of mechanisms expressed as programs and the explosion of perception they generate.
If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!
