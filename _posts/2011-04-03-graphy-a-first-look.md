Graphy is a teaching and learning tool that let's you visualize graph theoretic algorithms on
graphs you can construct yourself. The image above shows one of the graphs we tested Graphy's
step-by-step visualization expertise on; I never thought a depth first search would look that
cool. [Get Graphy](http://emaadmanzoor.github.io/graphy/)!
