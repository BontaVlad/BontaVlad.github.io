It's pretty routine to see the flustered Linux user feverishly banging on CTRL - ALT - DELETE,
trying to get his misbehaving Linux box to do something familiar. And then finally giving up and
pulling the plug, probably frying his motherboard or corrupting his hard drive in the process.

If you ever see yourself (or anyone else) in this pitiful situation, you need to be nice to your
Linux box, stop treating it like a Windows one and key in this combination:

{% highlight console %} 
ALT - PRINTSCREEN - R - E - I - S - U - B
{% endhighlight %}

Note that **REISUB** is **BUSIER** in reverse!

Then sit back and watch your system gracefully log itself off and proceed to restart.
