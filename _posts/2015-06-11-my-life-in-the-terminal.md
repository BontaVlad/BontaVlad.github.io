Short description

TODO:

- terminal
terminal matters, term color pallete, terminal fonsts
- zsh
much cooler than bash, compatible with bash, awsome autocomplete sugestions,
with plugins completion/suggestions for git, tmux, doker, you name it
- zpresto
theme for zsh, much like omyzsh, tons of plugins, verry configurable
- tmux
this could not be possibile without tmux, tabs turbo charged
- tmuxinator
save tmux presets, an essential tool in my toolshed
- hf
fuzzy finder for files in folders, useful for quick opening a file for edit,
could be used with any command that takes a file as a paramater eg. git add, rm, cp, so on and so forth
- tree
super useful, displays directory strucure recursevly as a tree, can set the
depth of recursion
- ag
like grep but much much faster, super useful, I use it mostly in vim
- neovim
vim but with maitainable source code, active development, async functionality
builtin, lua plugins,
- pudb
debugger of choice, ncurse terminal debugger,
- ptpython
python shell on steroiz
- bpython
same as above, less features but more pleasent on the eye for me
- vagrant
- mosh
cool ssh client/server for laggy or unreliable internet connections
- gitg
this is where i cheat a bit, Gui git client, useful for big changes, big commits
- meld
THE BEST merge/diff tool out there for git, super useful
- midnight commander
For those who know total commander for windows will be quite at home with mc,
this time right in the terminal

next part I will talk about, configurations, vim plugins, and more.
