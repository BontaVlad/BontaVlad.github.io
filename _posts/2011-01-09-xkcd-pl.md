Get xkcd.pl [here](https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/xkcd.pl).
 
A simple Perl script to rip the entire bunch of [xkcd](http://www.xkcd.com) webcomics to your
hard disk. This script is a Perl rendition of [xkcd.get()](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xkcdget/)
and a number of similar webcomic-to-local-disk aggregators littered all over the web, with a
notable difference being the addition of the tooltip as a caption to the downloaded xkcd 
webcomic image.

## Requirements

   * Perl
   * imagemagick
   * wget

The usual `apt-get` should fix any dependency errors.

## Features

   * On first run, downloads all the xkcd comics to date to the user's home directory.
   * Doesn't re-download comics already present, so it can be run as a cron job thrice
     a week, fetching only the latest comic each time.
   * Adds the tooltip of the xkcd comic being downloaded as a caption to the image.
