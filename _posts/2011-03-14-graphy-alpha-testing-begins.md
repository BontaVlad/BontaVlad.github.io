Take [Graphy-alpha](http://emaadmanzoor.github.com/graphy/) for a little walk!
 
And we **mean** alpha; which is a polite way of telling you that if you're nice to Graphy,
Graphy **might** be nice to you. Hey, it's not going to fry your computer, so give it a try!
Post in whatever you'd like to say, ask or complain about in the comments to this post; we'll
compile the frequent questions and complaints into our wiki as soon as we get the time.
