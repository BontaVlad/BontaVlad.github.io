title: The Case of Lenovo India
tags:
---

TLDR: Ordered a Z510 from Lenovo India's [The Do Store][1] on May 31; received
a damaged laptop on June 7; struggled for a refund/replacement, eventually
sending a legal notice; received a refund on August 1.
 
This post started off as a rant, but has since become an analysis. I hope this
serves useful to potential Lenovo buyers, especially since their recent [Y and
Z series](http://www.thedostore.com/ideapad-y50.html) launch in India with 3
years of extended warranty that is useless in practice.

My theory is that Lenovo has been recently siphoning off defective parts to
India and has not hired qualified support personnel to make repairs, including
business-critical Think-brand machines. This is different from the occasional
defect issues faced by any company: Lenovo has no option but to offer a refund,
or stall the customer until they give up. This probably explains many of the
complaints observable on their [Facebook page][2].

The following is a timeline of events, followed by the story in pictures:

There was no response to this ticket (never was throughout the entire story).
I made a few calls to Lenovo support. They had no idea about the aforementioned
ticket or what The Do Store is. I was asked to provide additional details in
order to obtain a DOA (dead-on-arrival) certificate.

On June 12, a support engineer arrived at my place, inspected the laptop and
issued us the DOA certificate. We communicated this back to Lenovo. This started
a long, long thread with multiple recipients across Lenovo's partner network.
I have masked out names and email addresses in the images that follow.

Also note that there were two Wipro employees who greatly sped up the process,
but still could not do much in the face of Lencare's incompetence.

I had to use Dropbox due to Lencare's 10MB attachment limit. This was
not received well.

Over another phone call to Lenovo support, I am asked to email the invoice on
the same thread.

[![Sending my invoice](/images/lenovo/2014-06-18.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-06-18.png)

*June 18:* Sending my invoice

Following this email, there was no response for a week. I followed up asking for
one (a response on this thread never arrived).

[![Requesting response 1](/images/lenovo/2014-06-24.1.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-06-24.1.png)

*June 24:*: Requesting a response after getting none for a week
{:.caption}

To my surprise, further phone calls revealed that my case had been rejected. No
reason was provided.

Seeing nothing working, I took to Twitter.

{:.caption}

After more calls, Lenovo support claimed that I filed the complaint after 7 days
of purchase (the laptop took 7 days to arrive), which was too late. I had still
not heard anything back in writing. I emailed asking for clarification.

[![Clarification for reason](/images/lenovo/2014-06-25.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-06-25.png)

*June 25:* Asking why the provided reason makes sense
{:.caption}

No response. I began contacting my lawyer. At the same time, I wanted a
confirmed rejection from Lenovo in writing.

*June 27:* Requesting the verdict of rejection in writing
{:.caption}

After even more calls to Lenovo support and more noise on Twitter and Facebook,
I was asked to CC my email to another address.

[![CC'ing the Do store](/images/lenovo/2014-06-27.2.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-06-27.2.png)

*June 27:* CC'ing the Do store
{:.caption}

I finally obtained a rejection in writing via Lenovo India's Facebook page.
They claimed it was due to "customer-induced damage". Make note of this
expression and notice how it is forgotten after sending the legal notice.

[![Rejection in writing](/images/lenovo/2014-06-27.3.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-06-27.3.png)

*June 28:* Receiving the rejection in writing
{:.caption}

A distraction: The Do Store asks me to send in photographs of the product. I had
to lose my cool at this point.

[![The Do Store requests photos](/images/lenovo/2014-06-28.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-06-28.png)

*June 28:* The Do Store requests photographs

Two days later, the DOA team wants to take a look at my delivery challan,
to validate the claim that I received the product only on June 7.

[![Request for delivery challan](/images/lenovo/2014-06-30.1.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-06-30.1.png)

## July

I had finalized the legal notice with my lawyer at this stage. It was posted
on July 1. The header below has an earlier date since it's from a draft.

[![Legal notice header](/images/lenovo/2014-07-01.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-01.png)

I heard back from Lenovo on July 3!

[![DOA certificate generated](/images/lenovo/2014-07-03.1.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-03.1.png)

*July 3:* DOA certificate generated

I provided the details requested, but didn't hear back for another week.

[![Requesting response to cheque details](/images/lenovo/2014-07-07.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-07.png)

*July 7:* Requesting a response for my cheque details
{:.caption}

Conveniently, the ticket I had created on June 7 was marked resolved. So it
appears someone at the NDSL distributor's had seen it but ignored it all this
while.

[![Ticket resolved](/images/lenovo/2014-07-11.1.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-11.1.png)

*July 11:* Ticket marked resolved
{:.caption}

I also received a nice post from NDSL distributors, claiming that it was a
manufactoring defect and apologizing profusely. Remember the claim of
"customer-induced damage"?

[![Post from NDSL](/images/lenovo/post.jpg)](/images/lenovo/post.jpg)

*July 11:* Post from the NDSL distributors
{:.caption}

I also heard back from Lencare that they could not accept the cheque details I
desired, because they needed the cheque payee to be the same person as the
invoice recipient. I'm not sure why this took a week to notice.

[![Validating cheque details](/images/lenovo/2014-07-11.2.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-11.2.png)

*July 11:* Validating cheque details
{:.caption}

[![Confirming cheque details](/images/lenovo/2014-07-11.3.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-11.3.png)

*July 11:* Confirming cheque details
{:.caption}

They accepted my details and said I'd receive communication within 8-10 working
days, which I did from Proconnect supply chain management. Notice that they
claim "Bluedart" would be making the delivery.

[![Proconnect communication](/images/lenovo/2014-07-17.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-17.png)

*July 17:* Communication from Proconnect
{:.caption}

I didn't hear back for another week, so I decided to check in.

[![Requesting response from Proconnect](/images/lenovo/2014-07-26.1.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-26.1.png)

*July 26:* Requesting a response from Proconnect
{:.caption}

I get a response almost immediately, saying the cheque has been dispatched via
GMS courier, not Bluedart!

[![Notification of GMS courier](/images/lenovo/2014-07-26.2.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-26.2.png)

*July 26:* GMS courier, not Bluedart!
{:.caption}

It is not possible to track the location of a GMS courier shipment; the tracking
page returns dummy results.

[![Unable to track GMS](/images/lenovo/2014-07-26.3.png)](/images/lenovo/2014-07-26.3.png)

*July 26:*: Unable to track GMS courier consignments
{:.caption}

I never received any response to this. But I did receive my cheque in another 9
days, and returned the laptop.

*July 30:*: Received cheque, returned laptop
