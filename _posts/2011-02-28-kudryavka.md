Kudryavka, they called me. Little Curly. I was gifted a small but tidy contraption to spend the
night in, dinner with the chef's complements. Flattered as I was, I found the platter queer,
unused to the semi-solid delicacies I was being treated to.

The next nineteen days saw me being transferred to alternate accomodation by the day, each
contraption smaller than the last. It had been days since I defecated. The colorful world had
lost its sheen. I didn't like the food anymore. I missed Father.

It wasn't long before I was finally taken out and transferred to a peculiar contraption.
It wasn't unlike my earlier homes, in size. But the metallic finish, the lights and switches
adorning the walls, gave no aura of warmth. I whined, to get away, and also in fear that I
wouldn't fit the crevice that seemed to be my placeholder. It was only after they fastened
me in that I realised just how much lighter I'd become. I could feel my heart against my ribs;
it seemed to be beating faster since the past few days.

I spent the next two days adjusting to my metallic shelter. I could sense something in the air.
Something was going to happen. Soon.
