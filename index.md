I am a second-year masters student in the [InfoCloud][1] research group at
[KAUST][2]. I am working with [Panos Kalnis][3] on broadcast scheduling in
social networks. I previously worked with [Xiangliang Zhang][5] on Android
malware classification using graphical models. I am broadly interested in
social, economic, graph and game theory.

I was previously a software engineer at [Yahoo!][6] where I worked in the
[Timesense](/yahoo/) team. Before that, I was an undergraduate at
[BITS - Pilani, Goa Campus][4].
